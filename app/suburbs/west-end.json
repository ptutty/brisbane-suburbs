     ["West End, Highgate Hill, and Dutton Park, located on the south side of Brisbane, are great suburbs within close distance to the City and UQ St Lucia Campus and also offer a range of living arrangements in a diverse area. ",
     "The low-lying suburb of West End, being just south of the Southbank area, is considered one of Brisbane’s most successful multicultural areas. With a diverse population, it is also a hub for multi-national restaurants and shops along Boundary Road. Situated just south of West End are Highgate Hill, which much like its name describes, is one of Brisbane’s hilly suburbs offering amazing views of the City skyline, and Dutton Park, offering easy travel to UQ St Lucia via the Green Bridge.",
     "The suburbs are home to many students, young families and professionals. Housing in the area ranges from individual houses to units and townhouses. Shared accommodation ranges approximately from $175 per week while individual accommodation ranges approximately from $700 per week. Accommodation prices vary depending on location and unit.",
     "The suburbs are well serviced by public transportation including bus, trains, and ferries. While buses travel to the City and UQ St Lucia, the ferry at West End makes for a quick trip across the river to St Lucia or a lovely walk across the Green Bridge to campus. The suburbs are also nearby to the train stations at Dutton Park and South Brisbane.",
     "The suburbs have a vibrant entertainment atmosphere with plenty of small café’s, restaurants, shops, pubs, markets and street festivals throughout the year, making West End, Highgate Hill, and Dutton Park great places to call home."
