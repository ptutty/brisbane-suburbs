    "description": 
     ["St Lucia is home to UQ’s largest campus and as a result a lot of students choose to live here so they can roll out of bed and into their early morning lectures. The campus is situated at one end of the suburb and is surrounded by the gorgeous Brisbane River on three sides.",
     "As a result of its proximity to the City and the uni, St Lucia is an interesting mix of budget student digs and multi million dollar riverfront homes. It is still possible however, to find a great place to live, either in a share house or apartment within easy commute to campus.",
     "The main shopping area is Hawken Village, with a supermarket, great range of shops and cheap restaurants perfect for budget conscious students. There’s also the almost famous Asian supermarket on Sir Fred Schonell Drive if you can't find what you want there, it doesn't exist!",
     "From St Lucia you can travel really easily into the City or Valley for a night out, and the neighbouring suburbs of Toowong and Indooroopilly both offer train connections and shopping malls.",
     "One of the real charms of the suburb is the range of riverside parks and walks most offering free barbeque facilities and WiFi. Guyatt Park is a particularly popular spot for weekend parties and celebrations just get there early to claim your spot.",
     "Cycling is also a very popular way to get around, with a bikeway from UQ leading all the way into the City centre."
