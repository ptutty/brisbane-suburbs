     ["Located to the east of the city centre, New Farm is Brisbaneâ€™s most heavily populated suburb, owing to its cool, cosmopolitan feel. The suburb is a favourite for young singles and couples, however the mix of accommodation in the area means that there is something to suit everyone's needs and budget. ",
     "The suburb is a mix of traditional and older style houses and cottages, (which can be a little expensive to rent) as well as super trendy apartment buildings. There are quite a lot of new-ish apartment buildings, which may not be very pretty, but the location makes up for it! ",
     "Given its popularity it may be surprising that you can still find somewhere to live on a tight student budget. Whilst it is getting more expensive, an older-style, unfurnished studio or one bedroom apartment averages about $240 per week. Houseshares can be found in the area for $185 upwards, but can be a bit hard to find depending on the time of year.",
     "One of the major drawcards of the suburb is New Farm Park, a large open green space that backs onto the Brisbane River. There are regular farmers markets and other events held in the park, and it is a lovely place for soaking up the sun.",
     "Head to James Street for a great range of cafes and a fresh food market. Some of the shops may be a little pricy for a student budget however looking is free! The cinema is also on James St. The other main shopping area is Merthyr Village on Brunswick Street, where there is a range of stores and a supermarket.",
     "Public transport is very convenient in the area. There are two citycat stops, as well as high-frequency buses down Brunswick Street."],
