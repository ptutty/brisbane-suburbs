     ["Woolloongabba and Kangaroo Point are two inner-city suburbs with a variety of places to live and plenty of things to see and do. Located just across the river from the City, it’s also easy to travel from one place to another. ",
     "The suburb of Woollongabba is well known as the home of the Brisbane Cricket Ground, the Gabba; while Kangaroo Point is located on high cliffs offering beautiful views of the CBD and the Story Bridge. The Princess Alexandra Hospital is also located in Woolloongabba. ",
     "While many residents live in high-rise apartments, there are also smaller unit blocks and historic Queenslander style homes available in the area as well. Prices range from approximately $175 per week for shared accommodation to approximately $560 per week for individual units or houses. The actual cost of housing depends significantly on unit and location. Because of the close proximity to the City and other areas of Brisbane, the majority of residents in the area are students or young professionals. ",
     "Public transportation in the area is easy to find as buses frequently run throughout the two suburbs with access to the South East Busway via the Woolloongabba Busway Station. Train stations are also nearby at the Park Road, Buranda and South Brisbane Stations. If you would rather cycle to classes, there are also a number of bicycle paths that travel through Woolloongabba and Kangaroo Point to the City, UQ St Lucia and beyond.",
     "Close proximity to the City also means that there’s always something to do. With many shops, restaurants, and easy access to the City, the Valley, and Southbank, there’s something to suit anyone’s personal tastes here."],
